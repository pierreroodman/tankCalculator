# tankCalculator
A tool to calculate calibration data for a capacitive fuel level sensor

This tool is meant to be used for fuel level sensors used in conjunction with GPS fleet monitoring systems.

There are 4 common tank shapes that can typically be found on trucks i.e. Rectangular (cuboid), horizontal cylindrical, horizontal eliptical and D-shaped (Volvo truck tanks).

The tool gives the user a choice between the 4 shapes and then requests the dimensions as well as the current fuel level of the tank being calibrated.

When the user has entered the dimensions, the tool will give all the necessary data for installation and calibration of the sensor namely:

The Max volume of the tank in litres.
The current volume of fuel in the tank in litres.
The length in cm to cut the sensor to.
Volume of tank in litres for each percentage point that the sensor is immersed in fuel from 0% to 100% sensor immersion.

This tool is meant to be used in conjunction with the calibration tool provided by suppliers of capacitive sensors.
